# StockReady

## Codeclan Solo Python/Flask Project

This is a Python project for the (Codeclan)[https://www.codeclan.com/] software development course.

The brief began as: "Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is
not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers."

A sample of the project planning documentation is available in the `planning` directory.

### Rules

As this is a Codeclan project it had to follow some rules:

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL and psycopg

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.
